# 🚀 Real-Time News Intelligence System

## 📌 Overview
A **graph-based real-time intelligence system** that ingests live news feeds, applies **NLP, topic modeling, community detection, and sentiment analysis**, and visualizes the evolving web of global narratives.

Unlike a simple dashboard, this system builds a **living, breathing network of news** that captures how stories connect, influence, and evolve.

## 🧠 Core Objectives
- Track global information flows in real time  
- Detect emerging communities of thought as they form  
- Quantify narrative influence and sentiment patterns  

## 💡 System Highlights
- 🔹 **Live Ingestion Pipeline** — pulling fresh news via RSS (Google News)  
- 🔹 **TF-IDF + LDA Topic Modeling** — extracting dominant themes  
- 🔹 **Graph Construction (NetworkX)** — building real-time similarity networks  
- 🔹 **Louvain Community Detection** — clustering related news stories  
- 🔹 **Sentiment Analysis (HuggingFace Transformers)** — polarity detection  
- 🔹 **Interactive Dash + Cytoscape.js** — dynamic graph visualization  
- 🔹 **Temporal & Structural Analysis** — centrality, timelines, community sentiment  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Dash / Plotly**  
- **Cytoscape.js**  
- **NetworkX**
